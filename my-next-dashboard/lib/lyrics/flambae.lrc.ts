[00:14.84]I hate the world today
[00:18.29]You're so good to me, I know, but I can't change
[00:23.22]Tried to tell you, but you look at me like maybe
[00:26.91]I'm an angel underneath
[00:30.37]Innocent and sweet
[00:32.42]
[00:33.77]Yesterday, I cried
[00:36.76]You must have been relieved to see the softer side
[00:41.93]I can understand how you'd be so confused
[00:46.23]I don't envy you
[00:48.40]I'm a little bit of everything all rolled into one
[00:53.13]
[00:53.14]I'm a bitch, I'm a lover
[00:55.64]I'm a child, I'm a mother
[00:58.14]I'm a sinner, I'm a saint
[01:00.86]I do not feel ashamed
[01:03.11]I'm your Hell, I'm your dream
[01:05.92]I'm nothing in between
[01:07.79]You know you wouldn't want it any other way
[01:12.66]
[01:13.30]So take me as I am
[01:16.77]This may mean you'll have to be a stronger man
[01:21.72]Rest assured that when I start to make you nervous
[01:25.46]And I'm going to extremes
[01:28.47]Tomorrow, I will change and today won't mean a thing
[01:32.95]
[01:32.96]I'm a bitch, I'm a lover
[01:35.49]I'm a child, I'm a mother
[01:37.99]I'm a sinner, I'm a saint
[01:40.70]I do not feel ashamed
[01:42.94]I'm your Hell, I'm your dream
[01:45.68]I'm nothing in between
[01:47.62]You know you wouldn't want it any other way
[01:52.46]
[02:13.63]Just when you think you got me figured out
[02:18.10]The season's already changing
[02:23.71]I think it's cool, you do what you do
[02:28.10]And don't try to save me
[02:32.43]
[02:32.67]I'm a bitch, I'm a lover
[02:35.27]I'm a child, I'm a mother
[02:37.75]I'm a sinner, I'm a saint
[02:40.46]I do not feel ashamed
[02:42.75]I'm your Hell, I'm your dream
[02:45.42]I'm nothing in between
[02:47.41]You know you wouldn't want it any other way
[02:52.25]
[02:52.68]I'm a bitch, I'm a tease
[02:55.17]I'm a goddess on my knees
[02:57.68]When you hurt, when you suffer
[03:00.14]I'm your angel undercover
[03:02.65]I've been numb, I'm revived
[03:05.33]Can't say I'm not alive
[03:07.31]You know I wouldn't want it any other way
[03:11.72]
